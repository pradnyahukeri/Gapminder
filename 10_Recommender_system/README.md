## Installing streamlit in a conda env

In your terminal type:

```bash
conda create --name streamlit_env 
```

To use streamlit_env:

```bash
conda activate streamlit_env
```

To install streamlit:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge streamlit
```

To install further library:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge --file requirements.txt
```

To check that everything works properly:

```bash
streamlit hello
```
(it should pop up a streamlit web app in your browser)

## Data analysis excercise on penguins
**Business goal:**

*Our marketing team would love to know about the penguins 🐧*

Use an editor (e.g., Vscode) to open the file penguins_excercise.py. Read the TODO doc string at the beginning of the file. 

Afterward we will create out of that a nice sort of dashboard using streamlit.
